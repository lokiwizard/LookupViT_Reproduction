# LookupViT_Reproduction
follow the paper published on ECCVï¼šhttps://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/11673.pdf

I try to reproduce the LookupViT, and conduct a simple training on minist dataset.

However, i try to train on the cifar10 and find the results are so bad. I am looking forward to the author's open-source release.
